# Xbox-CPU-interposer
This is the documentation for the 1,4ghz CPU upgrade for the original Xbox.
It is not meant as a Step-by-Step guide to perform the upgrade but to document the necessary details to do the upgrade yourself.

## ---WARNING---
You should be comfortable with BGA rework or at least know how to work with BGA components.
And it should also not be your first time soldering small smd components!

## Compatibility:
The CPU upgrade is compatible with every Xbox revision out there.
But it is recommended to use a rev1.0 up to a rev1.4 as these console revisions have the ability to use 128mb Ram.

## Useability
The CPU upgraded boards have a LOT more processing power compared to the stock 733Mhz CPU of the original xbox.
Downside of this is that retail games need to be patched to run at normal speeds again.
Some games need to be patched others don't.
The Patching Software is found in the "Software" tab.

## Why would you want such a console?
* Less slowdowns in retail games
* More processing power for emulation
* Not everyone has one of them!
