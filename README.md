# Xbox-CPU-interposer
This is the documentation for the 1,4ghz CPU upgrade for the original Xbox.

## ---WARNING---
* You should be comfortable with BGA rework or at least know how to work with BGA components.
* And it should also not be your first time soldering small smd components!

## Compatibility:
It's compatible with every motherboard revision of the original Xbox but you want a rev1.0 - rev1.4 for a couple reasons:
* Rev 1.5 doesn't exist!

Update: As the rev1.6 can now officially be upgraded to 128mb ram there's no real reason not to use it!
Only thing to mention is that the install is a little more complex as one electrolytic capacitor has to be moved.

## Useability
The CPU upgraded boards have a LOT more processing power compared to the stock 733Mhz CPU of the original xbox.  
Downside of this is that retail games need to be patched to run at normal speeds again.  
Some games need to be patched others don't.
The Patching Software is found in the "Software" tab.

## Why would you want such a console?
* Less slowdowns in retail games
* More processing power for emulation
* Not everyone has one of them!
* It's like the ultimate mod you can do to an Xbox
