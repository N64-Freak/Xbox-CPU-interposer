To be able to play retail games you will have to patch them to run at retail speeds again.  
This folder has the necessary patching tool to do so. Not all games need to be patched but it doesn't hurt to just patch them anyway.  
-- Playing retail games from disc won't work with all games as they will allways be unpatched and might not work!
