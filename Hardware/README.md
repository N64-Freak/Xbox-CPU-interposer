# Required Tools
For the upgrade you should have good tools to suceed. Specially good soldering equipment and a steady hand!
You will need:
* BGA Rework station (alternatively a Hot-air Station and a preheater)
* Temperature controlled soldering iron
* A set of tweezers to install the smd components
* Solder paste and dispenser
* Solder wick to clean the board after removing the original CPU
* And of course flux!

## Choosing a processor
If you do the upgrade it is recommended to choose the 1400Mhz version of the processor.  
But because they get expensiver i recommend to use a 1000Mhz or 1200Mhz CPU to practice and continue with the expensiver CPU once you succeeded.  
  
Here's a list of tested CPUs:
| SSPEC Number | Clock speed | Cache |  
| SL5XL | 1400Mhz |  512Kb |  
| SL6BY | 1400Mhz |  512Kb |  
| SL5VX | 1333Mhz |  256Kb |  
| SL6BZ | 1333Mhz |  256Kb |  
| SL5LW | 1266Mhz |  512Kb |  
| SL5VX | 1200Mhz |  256Kb |  
| ... | ... | ... |  
  
Basically any Socket 370 Pentium 3 with 133Mhz FSB will work. The tualatin core CPUs are recommended as the heatspreader allows for easier heatsink attachment and they have 512kKB Level 2 Cache!
